                <h1>Resident Evil</h1>
                <p>
                    known as Biohazard (バイオハザード, Baiohazādo) in Japan, is a Japanese <br>
                    horror game series and media franchise created by Capcom. It consists <br>
                    of survival horror, third-person shooter and first-person shooter games, <br>
                    with players typically surviving in environments inhabited by zombies <br>
                    and other mutated creatures. The franchise has expanded into other media, <br>
                    including a live-action film series, animated films, television series, <br>
                    comic books, novels, audiobooks, and merchandise. Resident Evil is the <br>
                    highest-grossing horror franchise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first Resident Evil game was created by Shinji Mikami and Tokuro <br>
                    Fujiwara for PlayStation, and released in 1996. It is credited for <br>
                    defining the survival horror genre and returning zombies to popular <br>
                    culture. With Resident Evil 4 (2005), the franchise shifted to more <br> 
                    dynamic shooting action, popularizing the "over-the-shoulder" <br>
                    third-person view in action-adventure games.
                </p>

                <img src="./img/re2-2.webp" alt="">
                <p>
                    The franchise returned to survival horror with Resident Evil 7: Biohazard (2017) and <br>
                    Resident Evil Village (2021), which used a first-person perspective. Capcom has also <br> 
                    released four Resident Evil remakes: Resident Evil (2002), Resident Evil 2 (2019), <br>
                    Resident Evil 3 (2020) and Resident Evil 4 (2023). Resident Evil is Capcom's <br>
                    best-selling franchise and the best-selling horror game series, with more than 160 <br> 
                    million copies sold worldwide as of December 2024.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first Resident Evil film was released in 2002, starring Milla Jovovich, followed by five sequels and a reboot, <br> 
                    Welcome to Raccoon City (2021). The films received mostly negative reviews, but have grossed more than $1.2 billion, <br> 
                    making Resident Evil the third-highest-grossing video game film series.

                    <p>
                        Resident Evil 2[a] is a 2019 survival horror game developed and published by <br>
                        Capcom. A remake of the 1998 game Resident Evil 2, it was released for <br> 
                        PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One in January 2019 and for Amazon Luna, <br> 
                        PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch in 2022. Versions for iOS, <br> 
                        iPadOS, and macOS were released in December 2024. Players control the rookie <br> 
                        police officer Leon S. Kennedy and the college student Claire Redfield as they <br> 
                        attempt to escape Raccoon City during a zombie outbreak.

                    <p>
                        Depending on which order the scenarios are played in, the player experiences one of two <br> 
                        courses of events which mutually contradict each other. This plot summary covers only <br> 
                        the path followed by playing the Claire A and Leon B scenarios, which was suggested by <br> 
                        Capcom to be the canon version of events.

                            Resident Evil 3 is a 2020 survival horror game developed and published by <br> 
                            Capcom. It is a remake of the 1999 game Resident Evil 3: Nemesis. Players <br> 
                            control former elite agent Jill Valentine and mercenary Carlos Oliveira as <br> 
                            they attempt to find a vaccine and escape from a city during a zombie outbreak. <br> 
                            The game is played from a third-person perspective and requires the player to <br> 
                            solve puzzles and defeat monsters while being pursued by a creature called Nemesis. <br> 
                            It was released for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One in April 2020 and for Amazon <br> 
                            Luna, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S in June 2022, with a Nintendo Switch cloud <br> 
                            version released in November 2022.

                            Resident Evil 3 is a survival horror third-person shooter game. The player <br> 
                            controls Resident Evil protagonist Jill Valentine through most of the game; <br> 
                            certain sections require the player to control a supporting character, Carlos <br> 
                            Oliveira, for short periods. The player must explore the environment to open <br> 
                            doors, climb ladders, and pick up items. When an item is collected, it is <br> 
                            stored in an inventory that can be accessed at any time. Items in the inventory <br> 
                            can be used, examined, and combined to solve puzzles and gain access to areas <br> 
                            that were previously inaccessible. The player may pick up maps to reveal <br> 
                            unexplored sections in the game's automap, which shows the player's current <br> 
                            position and indicates if an area still has items to collect. Cutscenes with <br> 
                            occasional quick time events are featured at regular intervals to advance <br> 
                            the story.

                        and Resident Evil 3 (2020). Resident Evil 4 features redesigned visuals, designed <br> 
                        to create a tenser atmosphere, along with new character designs and backgrounds. <br> 
                        It offers six control schemes, including one styled after the original game. <br> 
                        Occasionally the player must solve puzzles to reach certain areas. In some <br>

                        <p>
                            Resident Evil Village is a 2021 survival horror game developed and published <br> 
                            by Capcom. It is the sequel to Resident Evil 7: Biohazard (2017) and the eighth <br> 
                            main game of the Resident Evil series. Players control Ethan Winters, who searches <br> 
                            for his kidnapped daughter in a mysterious village filled with mutant creatures. <br> 
                            Village maintains survival horror elements from previous games, with players <br> 
                            scavenging environments for items and managing resources while adding more <br> 
                            action-oriented gameplay, with higher enemy counts and a greater emphasis <br> 
                            on combat.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Like its predecessor, Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, Resident Evil Village <br> 
                            uses a first-person perspective, and has the option for a third-person <br> 
                            perspective. It is set in a snowy explorable European village, described as <br> 
                            "pulled straight from the Victorian era" and much larger and more immersive <br> 
                            than its predecessor. Structures and buildings in the central village can <br> 
                            be climbed and used to fight enemies. Compared to Biohazard, the game is <br> 
                            more action focused, with protagonist Ethan Winters equipped with more <br> 
                            combat skills due to military training. The game's primary enemies, <br> 
                            the werewolf-like Lycans, are agile and intelligent and can wield <br> 
                            weapons and attack in packs, forcing the player to rethink their <br> 
                            strategy on whether to use sparse ammunition, use melee combat, or run <br> 
                            away. Similar to Resident Evil 4 (2005), makeshift barricades <br> 
                            can be used to fend off enemies.

                        In addition to home, online, mobile, arcade, pachinko, and pachislot games, Capcom <br>
                        publishes strategy guides; maintains its own Plaza Capcom arcade centers in Japan; <br> 
                        and licenses its franchise and character properties for tie-in products, movies, <br> 
                        television series, and stage performances.

                    <p>
                        Although the company often relies on existing franchises, it has also published <br> 
                        and developed several titles for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii based on <br> 
                        original intellectual property: Lost Planet: Extreme Condition, Dead Rising, <br> 
                        Dragon's Dogma, Asura's Wrath, and Zack and Wiki. During this period, <br> 
                        Capcom also helped publish several original titles from up-and-coming Western <br> 
                        developers, including Remember Me, Dark Void, and Spyborgs, titles other <br> 
                        publishers were not willing to gamble on. Other games of note are the <br> 
                        titles Ōkami, Ōkamiden, and Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective.
